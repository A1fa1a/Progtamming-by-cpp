# Programming by cpp
Welcome to the "Programming by cpp" repository! This repository is a collection of cpp codes where you can find various examples and exercises to learn and improve your cpp coding skills, I will put everything i have learned about cpp in this repository.
## Description
### code 1: functionOfStructure.cpp
Description: The code (`functionOfStructure`) make a "stInfo" structure then it defines a readInfo procedure of type "stInfo", the "readInfo" procedure take one parameter of type "stInfo" buy reference is called "info" and it use the "info" parameter to access the member of "stInfo" structure to order name, age, country and city from the user, In then we have "printInfo" procedure it also take "info" parameter of type "stInfo" to access the structure members and print informations in the console, In the end wo have the main function it count a "info" variable of type "stInfo" and it call "readInfo" and "printInfo" which are used the variable "info".

## Usage
Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the directory and explore the scripts available. Each script is named descriptively to indicate its purpose or the concept it demonstrates.

To execute a CPP code, you can use the following command:
```bash
clang file_name.cpp -o file_name.cpp -lstdc++
```
Remember to make the code executable if it's not already:
